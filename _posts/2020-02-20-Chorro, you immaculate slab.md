El Chorro, Europe's winter getaway. With Dec-feb temperatures raging up to 30 it is the perfect destination for those who don't like freezing their fingers off on their local crags. Yes, Chorro is is as its name alludes, (well, any spanish-sounding name does to me), sunbathing galore for the average climber. Where in the summer it may get up to 45 degrees celsius, even in the winter you must humble in its heat, for Chorro knows very little sun-sheltered walls.

 To me **Chorro** is the immaculate slab. Or perhaps any destination is, seeing as I tend to slab better. Chorro has been an insightful short trip, a reminder of my skills and and grasp in the past, as it wasn't my first visit. In this exploratory blog post (as it is my first), I will try to establish some kind of rhythm and structure to my writing. I do not know if anyone will actually read this :p.
